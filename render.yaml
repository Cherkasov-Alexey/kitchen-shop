# Notes:
# - Render will create a managed Postgres and expose a DATABASE_URL for it.
# - In this project `backend/src/index.js` expects DB connection via DB_HOST/DB_USER/DB_PASSWORD/DB_NAME/DB_PORT environment variables.
#   After the database is provisioned you should add these environment variables in the Render dashboard (or adjust the app to use DATABASE_URL).
